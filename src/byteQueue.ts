/**
 * Bytes from a stream, kept as they arrived and taken off the front a whole message at a time. Joining each arrival
 * onto all that is still waiting copies all of it again every time: a message that comes a byte at a time (a server
 * can send one-byte TLS records) costs the square of its size, on the thread that runs Tabby's window. Here a byte is
 * copied in once, as it arrives, and at most once more, when the message it is in is taken.
 *
 * What arrives is copied into storage of the queue's own rather than kept as it came: a piece can be a few bytes of a
 * much larger buffer (a TLS record that also held other frames, say), and keeping the piece would keep all of that
 * buffer too. A sender that had each record add a byte to a message it never finishes could otherwise have a whole
 * record kept for every byte. So the queue holds what is waiting, and at most two slabs more.
